                            <br>Within the app, we have included a collection of microscopic organisms that we have observed closely through the prism of a microscope. Each encounter with these tiny creatures was an opportunity to explore the mysteries of life at the microscopic level. We have taken detailed images and carefully investigated each organism, gathering valuable information about their biology, habitat and behavior.
                            <br> Thus, we created comprehensive and engaging descriptions that not only educate users, but also arouse their curiosity. All the information and images resulting from this research were meticulously organized into a database, a rich and accessible resource for anyone who wants to learn. This database was then integrated into the application, offering users an interactive and discovery-filled experience in the fascinating world of microorganisms.
                            <br> MicroCosmos is not just an educational app; it is a window into a world full of life and diversity, waiting to be discovered. We want every user to feel the wonder and fascination that we felt during this process of exploration.
